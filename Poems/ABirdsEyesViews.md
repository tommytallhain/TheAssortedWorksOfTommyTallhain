````{card} 
Near the white-weathered stons. In the soft misty air
<br>
Sat a bird in a tree and he perched with great care
<br>
With his eyes sightly up and his neck slightly bent
<br>
He gazed at the scene in its lucid extent
<br>
In the mist and the cold of the frigid snowfall
<br>
He sat on his branch and he looked at it all
<br>
The footprints of others which lay in the frost
<br>
Marked no only life but the love that was lost
<br>
Passers-by didn't notice him watching them leave
<br>
Their flowers and memories, their tokens of grief
<br>
But watch them he did, and still did he stand
<br>
Watching visitors come to be laid in the land
<br>
And the unhappy thoughtwhich occured from his cover
<br>
Was that he could guage much, in the eyes of another
<br>
So up flew the raven, up, up, from the rift
<br>
Of the sorrow and sadness, of the night graveyard shift
<br>
