## A Seen

````{card}
From world weary eyes
<br>
Come world weary views
<br>
With thoughts that lay stripped back
<br>
And somber subdued
<br>
Of cascading thoughts
<br>
And the flight paths of dreams
<br>
Poetic death, justice
<br>
From kings and from queens
<br>
Who sit high above
<br>
On a window ledge place 
<br>
Looking out at the vastness
<br>
of vast ever space
<br>
Yet end soon the lead will
<br>
the visage between,
<br>
Its all I have looked for
<br>
But its not what they,ve seen
<br>

## The Truth?

````{card}
Ranking and repuation
<br>
The segmented way
<br>
Of societal expectation
<br>
I'd dare say I don't say
<br>
Take care to do what's right
<br>
Though what's right is wrong today
<br>
And if you do what's wrong
<br>
You'll be spoken of that way
<br>
Remember reputation  
<br>
For without it waht are you?
<br>
a person with their values
<br>
Surely not, impossible too.
<br>
Can they be the same?
<br>
Of course, but there's the choice
<br>
To stay true and be you
<br>
You'll have to fix the broken voice
<br>

## October dawns
```{margin} Aside
After arriving home early in the mirning after a night out this photo was taken and inspired by its beauty I was compelled to write this
```

````{card}
The morning hues and misty dew, fall out across the scene
<br>
The flight of birds and chirps were heard, but still untouched serent
<br>
Of coloured sky and rainbow dye, the view is panted, mourn
<br>
The end of nights and wistful sprites danced late October dawn
<br>

## The Universe Edge
````{card}
Strung-up stars in the shadow lie glinting
<br>
Clusters of families inhabit dark space
<br>
Igniting the night time sky vision ceiling
<br>
Hoping to join that celestial race
<br>
Thrown round the hues of horizon divider
<br>
The earth and the sun with the moon born anew
<br>
In the light of the dusk constellation-age wonder
<br>
the twinkle of start dust and grandeur in view
<br>
Gaze up at this void, at the skyline asunder
<br>
Not too long can one stare at the filtering scene
<br>
With its beauty transformed in a picturesque framework
<br>
And your felling transfixed in this time-lengthend dream
<br>
So Silent I watch through my lens in the skies
<br>
A plane's window pane the perspective I see
<br>
The shining of sun rays that dance through the cloud tiers
<br>
Realizing myself and the vast galaxy
<br>
