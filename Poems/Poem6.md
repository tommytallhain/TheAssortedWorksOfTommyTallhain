````{card}
Strung-up stars in the shadow lie glinting
<br>
Clusters of families inhabit dark space
<br>
Igniting the night time sky vision ceiling
<br>
Hoping to join that celestial race
<br>
Thrown round the hues of horizon divider
<br>
The earth and the sun with the moon born anew
<br>
In the light of the dusk constellation-age wonder
<br>
the twinkle of start dust and grandeur in view
<br>
Gaze up at this void, at the skyline asunder
<br>
Not too long can one stare at the filtering scene
<br>
With its beauty transformed in a picturesque framework
<br>
And your felling transfixed in this time-lengthend dream
<br>
So Silent I watch through my lens in the skies
<br>
A plane's window pane the perspective I see
<br>
The shining of sun rays that dance through the cloud tiers
<br>
Realizing myself and the vast galaxy
<br>
