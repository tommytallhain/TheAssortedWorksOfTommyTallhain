````{card}
Ranking and repuation
<br>
The segmented way
<br>
Of societal expectation
<br>
I'd dare say I don't say
<br>
Take care to do what's right
<br>
Though what's right is wrong today
<br>
And if you do what's wrong
<br>
You'll be spoken of that way
<br>
Remember reputation  
<br>
For without it waht are you?
<br>
a person with their values
<br>
Surely not, impossible too.
<br>
Can they be the same?
<br>
Of course, but there's the choice
<br>
To stay true and be you
<br>
You'll have to fix the broken voice
<br>
