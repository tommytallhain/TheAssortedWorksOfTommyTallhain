````{card}
I skipped a stone and watched it go skimming off the glass like lake.
<br>
And in my hand I held yours tight the love caught in its wake.
<br>
It danced on waves and ripples made while running from the shore.
<br>
Your eyes on mine but still the sign of things and feelings more.
<br>
But soon it fell through life and tells its echos off the sound.
<br>
And dropped below to dpths unknown a weight that sunk to ground.
<br>
