````{card}
From world weary eyes
<br>
Come world weary views
<br>
With thoughts that lay stripped back
<br>
And somber subdued
<br>
Of cascading thoughts
<br>
And the flight paths of dreams
<br>
Poetic death, justice
<br>
From kings and from queens
<br>
Who sit high above
<br>
On a window ledge place 
<br>
Looking out at the vastness
<br>
of vast ever space
<br>
Yet end soon the lead will
<br>
the visage between,
<br>
Its all I have looked for
<br>
But its not what they,ve seen
<br>
