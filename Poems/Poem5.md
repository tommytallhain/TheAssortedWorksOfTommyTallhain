```{margin} Aside
After arriving home early in the mirning after a night out this photo was taken and inspired by its beauty I was compelled to write this
```

````{card}
The morning hues and misty dew, fall out across the scene
<br>
The flight of birds and chirps were heard, but still untouched serent
<br>
Of coloured sky and rainbow dye, the view is panted, mourn
<br>
The end of nights and wistful sprites danced late October dawn
<br>
