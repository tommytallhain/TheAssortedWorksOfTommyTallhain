## Flying Over Switzerland On A Monday Afternoon

The anatomy of the land.
<br>
Divisioning via the coastline.
<br>
Marbled dull greens of rocky mountain foliage
<br>
like epidermis under a microscope
<br>
sprouting out below and mingle with the
<br>
shadows of white haxe cloud rolling like flocks of etherial sheep over the hills.
<br>
At the beach waves seem like ripples at such heights
<br>
Their perceptible ebb and flow now lost
<br>
between the vast deep blue that mixes with the sky
<br>
as you turn your head towards the horizon
<br>
piercing theough sheets of cotton wool
<br>
endless layes of vaporesque cloud
<br>
Nesteled between mountains the small villages lie
<br>
Tiny patches of people amongst the Earths andgry rock
<br>
Breaking through forcing their way upward through granite fleshed ground
<br>
Mother nature's reward after years of toil.
<br>
These are not like the escarpemnts back home
<br>
falte and dull, levelled off and manicured each week by the gardener 
<br>
but rather 
<br>
elaborate
<br>
and pinnicled, majestic, in their stonewrok grandeur
<br>
as if crafted by siphous hands himself
<br>
but perhaps that is because I am not use to them
<br>
their snow flecked tips pure white 
<br>
through the suns rays like icing atop a cake
<br>
for it is the unfamiliar which we find beautiful 
<br>
and the well known more common place
<br>
if I were to see this sight again
<br>
at this time
<br>
at this hour
<br>
in this light
<br>
would I have written this
