## Flying Over Switzerland On A Monday Afternoon
````{card}
The anatomy of the land.
<br>
Divisioning via the coastline.
<br>
Marbled dull greens of rocky mountain foliage
<br>
like epidermis under a microscope
<br>
sprouting out below and mingle with the
<br>
shadows of white haxe cloud rolling like flocks of etherial sheep over the hills.
<br>
At the beach waves seem like ripples at such heights
<br>
Their perceptible ebb and flow now lost
<br>
between the vast deep blue that mixes with the sky
<br>
as you turn your head towards the horizon
<br>
piercing theough sheets of cotton wool
<br>
endless layes of vaporesque cloud
<br>
Nesteled between mountains the small villages lie
<br>
Tiny patches of people amongst the Earths andgry rock
<br>
Breaking through forcing their way upward through granite fleshed ground
<br>
Mother nature's reward after years of toil.
<br>
These are not like the escarpemnts back home
<br>
falte and dull, levelled off and manicured each week by the gardener 
<br>
but rather 
<br>
elaborate
<br>
and pinnicled, majestic, in their stonewrok grandeur
<br>
as if crafted by siphous hands himself
<br>
but perhaps that is because I am not use to them
<br>
their snow flecked tips pure white 
<br>
through the suns rays like icing atop a cake
<br>
for it is the unfamiliar which we find beautiful 
<br>
and the well known more common place
<br>
if I were to see this sight again
<br>
at this time
<br>
at this hour
<br>
in this light
<br>
would I have written this

## In Flight
```{margin} Aside
I wrote this while on a ferry in croatia. I was up on deck while the weather was slightly drizzling (I enjoy being in the rain and I much prefered it over the crowded cabins below deck where tourists clamoured and made me long for solitude). It was there I noticed a seagull flying alongside the ship. Its agility and aerial mastery so mystifying that I soon became distracted in writing this 
```

````{card}
Dancing in the salty air
<br>
Ebbs and flows like water there
<br>
His wings like pulleys deftly bend
<br>
Adjustments as he glides again
<br>
Left and right he weaves a way
<br>
suspened in mid day
<br>
<br>
<br>
His cowl of white is flecked with grey
<br>
To scavenge is his task today
<br>
On beached shoreline his leftover lay
<br>
Grateful is his way
<br>
the sky his home come warmth or cold
<br>
the sky his home of gold
<br>
<br>
<br>
Passing boats whose sails blow
<br>
Their nets turn out the fish they sow
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## After Endorphins
```{margin} Aside
The first part of this poem was composed in my head quite quickly after a swim in a local tidal pool one thursday evening in January in Cape Town. I couldn't quite come up with an ending to my liking and so left it and revisited it after a few months probably around July of the same year, where by I wrote the second half/latter part and cristened the poem complete
```

````{card}
In night time dust on crevice wing
<br>
I hear the jagged canyon sing
<br>
Of jackal tails, Coyote eyes
<br>
The hornet bees and firefiles
<br>
A star above a misty friend
<br>
Until the murky skies append
<br>
Upon their dewy midnght sea
<br>
A grandeur hung like tapestry
<br>
So haste beyond the crypt I go
<br>
Haste, past matter, too and fro
<br>
I wish for hours more I'd stay
<br>
I'll come back again one day
<br>
