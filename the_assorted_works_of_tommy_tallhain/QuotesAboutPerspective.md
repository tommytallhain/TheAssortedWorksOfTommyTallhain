# Quotes About Perspective


```{epigraph}
An airport is a child's plaything

-- Tommy Tallhain
```

```{sidebar} Aside
And by that I mean that children are the only people who have fun at airports. 
Adults are far too busy trying to look busy - checling gate positions, queriying at information desks with the atttendant, pretending to be enjoying their travelling experience. Only a child sees the airport for what it was intended for - the access portal to a whole world of possiblities
