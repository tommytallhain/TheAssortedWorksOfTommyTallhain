## I Skipped a Stone (The Feelings Pool)

````{card}
I skipped a stone and watched it go skimming off the glass like lake.
<br>
And in my hand I held yours tight the love caught in its wake.
<br>
It danced on waves and ripples made while running from the shore.
<br>
Your eyes on mine but still the sign of things and feelings more.
<br>
But soon it fell through life and tells its echos off the sound.
<br>
And dropped below to dpths unknown a weight that sunk to ground.

## A Bird's Eyes Views

````{card} 
Near the white-weathered stons. In the soft misty air
<br>
Sat a bird in a tree and he perched with great care
<br>
With his eyes sightly up and his neck slightly bent
<br>
He gazed at the scene in its lucid extent
<br>
In the mist and the cold of the frigid snowfall
<br>
He sat on his branch and he looked at it all
<br>
The footprints of others which lay in the frost
<br>
Marked no only life but the love that was lost
<br>
Passers-by didn't notice him watching them leave
<br>
Their flowers and memories, their tokens of grief
<br>
But watch them he did, and still did he stand
<br>
Watching visitors come to be laid in the land
<br>
And the unhappy thoughtwhich occured from his cover
<br>
Was that he could guage much, in the eyes of another
<br>
So up flew the raven, up, up, from the rift
<br>
Of the sorrow and sadness, of the night graveyard shift
<br>

## A Seen

````{card}
From world weary eyes
<br>
Come world weary views
<br>
With thoughts that lay stripped back
<br>
And somber subdued
<br>
Of cascading thoughts
<br>
And the flight paths of dreams
<br>
Poetic death, justice
<br>
From kings and from queens
<br>
Who sit high above
<br>
On a window ledge place 
<br>
Looking out at the vastness
<br>
of vast ever space
<br>
Yet end soon the lead will
<br>
the visage between,
<br>
Its all I have looked for
<br>
But its not what they,ve seen
<br>

## The Truth?

````{card}
Ranking and repuation
<br>
The segmented way
<br>
Of societal expectation
<br>
I'd dare say I don't say
<br>
Take care to do what's right
<br>
Though what's right is wrong today
<br>
And if you do what's wrong
<br>
You'll be spoken of that way
<br>
Remember reputation  
<br>
For without it waht are you?
<br>
a person with their values
<br>
Surely not, impossible too.
<br>
Can they be the same?
<br>
Of course, but there's the choice
<br>
To stay true and be you
<br>
You'll have to fix the broken voice
<br>

## October dawns
```{margin} Aside
After arriving home early in the mirning after a night out this photo was taken and inspired by its beauty I was compelled to write this
```

````{card}
The morning hues and misty dew, fall out across the scene
<br>
The flight of birds and chirps were heard, but still untouched serent
<br>
Of coloured sky and rainbow dye, the view is panted, mourn
<br>
The end of nights and wistful sprites danced late October dawn

## The universe Edge
````{card}
Strung-up stars in the shadow lie glinting
<br>
Clusters of families inhabit dark space
<br>
Igniting the night time sky vision ceiling
<br>
Hoping to join that celestial race
<br>
Thrown round the hues of horizon divider
<br>
The earth and the sun with the moon born anew
<br>
In the light of the dusk constellation-age wonder
<br>
the twinkle of start dust and grandeur in view
<br>
Gaze up at this void, at the skyline asunder
<br>
Not too long can one stare at the filtering scene
<br>
With its beauty transformed in a picturesque framework
<br>
And your felling transfixed in this time-lengthend dream
<br>
So Silent I watch through my lens in the skies
<br>
A plane's window pane the perspective I see
<br>
The shining of sun rays that dance through the cloud tiers
<br>
Realizing myself and the vast galaxy
<br>

## In Flight
```{margin} Aside
I wrote this while on a ferry in croatia. I was up on deck while the weather was slightly drizzling (I enjoy being in the rain and I much prefered it over the crowded cabins below deck where tourists clamoured and made me long for solitude). It was there I noticed a seagull flying alongside the ship. Its agility and aerial mastery so mystifying that I soon became distracted in writing this 
```

````{card}
Dancing in the salty air
<br>
Ebbs and flows like water there
<br>
His wings like pulleys deftly bend
<br>
Adjustments as he glides again
<br>
Left and right he weaves a way
<br>
suspened in mid day
<br>
<br>
<br>
His cowl of white is flecked with grey
<br>
To scavenge is his task today
<br>
On beached shoreline his leftover lay
<br>
Grateful is his way
<br>
the sky his home come warmth or cold
<br>
the sky his home of gold
<br>
<br>
<br>
Passing boats whose sails blow
<br>
Their nets turn out the fish they sow
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## After Endorphins
```{margin} Aside
The first part of this poem was composed in my head quite quickly after a swim in a local tidal pool one thursday evening in January in Cape Town. I couldn't quite come up with an ending to my liking and so left it and revisited it after a few months probably around July of the same year, where by I wrote the second half/latter part and cristened the poem complete
```

````{card}
In night time dust on crevice wing
<br>
I hear the jagged canyon sing
<br>
Of jackal tails, Coyote eyes
<br>
The hornet bees and firefiles
<br>
A star above a misty friend
<br>
Until the murky skies append
<br>
Upon their dewy midnght sea
<br>
A grandeur hung like tapestry
<br>
So haste beyond the crypt I go
<br>
Haste, past matter, too and fro
<br>
I wish for hours more I'd stay
<br>
I'll come back again one day
<br>
